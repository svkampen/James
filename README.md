## James, a simple IRC bot.

**Ohai.** James is an IRC bot I originally made just for fun.
Well, it's still just for fun, but also used to get to know
more about python.

### How it works

To make James work, you need a couple of libraries.

* Tweepy (optional, only if you want to enable tweeting)
* Oyoyo
* Python >= 2.6.5
* LXML
* Requests
