# RUINBot, a simple IRC bot.
## Made by: Sam van Kampen (svkampen)

**Ohai.** RUINBot is an IRC bot I originally made just for fun.
Well, it's still just for fun, but also used to get to know
more about python.

## Branches

### Master

The master branch will always have a (somewhat) stable release.
At the moment, this is not the case, but that's because I just started
to make this model the model as it is.

### Testing

The testing branch will have testing updates, which probably run fine,
You can download these, but it is not sure if they will run properly.

### Volatile

The volatile, or unstable branch, will always have the latest updates, 
but may be unstable and failing to work on your system/irc network.

Some commands may also be broken, so this is mainly for developers only.
