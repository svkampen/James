## James, a modular IRC bot

**Hello**. James is a modular IRC bot created by **svkampen**.
It is completely Unicode-proof (for as far as I know)

### Requirements
James requires the following libraries (all supplied by pip)

* Requests
* Straight Plugin

### Legal mumbojumbo
You can consider James effectively licensed under the MIT License as far as code re-use goes,
though there isn't currently a LICENSE file to redistribute.
Basically, you can use the code as long as you

* don't try to claim that you wrote stuff that you didn't
* you don't deceive people as to the free availability of this code, and 
* you don't hold me liable for it.
