[14:57:20] [#programming] <sim642> where's that code from? you wrote it?
[14:57:25] [#programming] <svkampen> yes
[14:57:51] [#programming] <sim642> you're trying to apply CMD_REGEX which is a regex string to the string input
[14:57:54] [#programming] <sim642> and get what
[14:58:03] [#programming] <svkampen> ehhh... what?
[14:58:11] [#programming] <svkampen> CMD_REGEX is of type boost::regex
[14:58:17] [#programming] <sim642> ok
[14:58:32] [#programming] <svkampen> boost::regex CMD_REGEX(pattern)
[14:58:38] [#programming] <svkampen> where pattern is a const char*
[14:59:04] [#programming] <sim642> what are you trying to do with that regex and input?
[14:59:10] [#programming] <sim642> why the iterator and stuff
[14:59:12] [#programming] <svkampen> trying to match
[14:59:13] [#programming] <svkampen> idk
[14:59:31] [#programming] <svkampen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804453/c-regular-expressions-with-boost-regex
[14:59:56] [#programming] <svkampen> I am probably doing it wrong
[15:00:07] [#programming] <sim642> what's your regex string
[15:01:00] [#programming] <sim642> the pattern
[15:01:59] [#programming] <svkampen> ([A-z]+) (.*)
[15:02:08] [#programming] <svkampen> just a test pattern
[15:02:23] [#programming] <sim642> Immediate problem with the pattern itself
[15:02:27] [#programming] <sim642> not the cause of your problem
[15:02:34] [#programming] <sim642> .* will match all spaces too
[15:02:40] [#programming] <sim642> so you will get a single argument from there
[15:02:42] [#programming] <svkampen> ([A-z]+) (\W*)
[15:02:47] [#programming] <svkampen> better?
[15:03:10] [#programming] <sim642> \W is non-word
[15:03:12] [#programming] <sim642> use \S
[15:03:16] [#programming] <svkampen> oh
[15:03:18] [#programming] <sim642> that's non-whitespace characters
[15:03:21] [#programming] <svkampen> I thought whitespace
[15:03:22] [#programming] <svkampen> hah
[15:03:23] [#programming] <svkampen> k
[15:03:51] [#programming] <sim642> regex iterator searches for all matches of your pattern in the string, not match the string to your pattern
[15:04:00] [#programming] <sim642> you need boost::regex_match
[15:04:32] [#programming] <sim642> if (boost::regex_match(input, m, CMD_REGEX))
[15:04:33] [#programming] <sim642> {
[15:04:44] [#programming] <sim642> . //successful
[15:04:45] [#programming] <sim642> }
[15:04:48] [#programming] <sim642> and before that
[15:04:51] [#programming] <sim642> you need to put
[15:04:52] [#programming] <svkampen> what is m?
[15:04:57] [#programming] <sim642> boost::smatch m;
[15:05:01] [#programming] <svkampen> oh okay
[15:05:03] [#programming] <sim642> that's the variable into which the results are put
[15:05:12] [#programming] <sim642> m[0] will be the matched string
[15:05:15] [#programming] <sim642> so everything
[15:05:25] [#programming] <sim642> m[1] will be first match group
[15:05:30] [#programming] <sim642> m[2] second etc
[15:05:41] [#programming] <sim642> all you do with the match will be in the if
[15:05:49] [#programming] <sim642> because if it doesn't match you can't do anything with it
[15:06:37] [#programming] <svkampen> so basically I was just doing it wrong
[15:06:44] [#programming] <sim642> m.length() gives you the number of matched groups
[15:06:47] [#programming] <sim642> yeah
[15:07:53] [#programming] <sim642> if you had studied the stackoverflow example then you'd have noticed it does a different thing
[15:11:19] [#programming] <sim642> do you get it to work?
[15:11:28] [#programming] <svkampen> well sort of
[15:12:07] [#programming] <sim642> sort of?
[15:13:26] [#programming] <svkampen> I assume it works
[15:13:33] [#programming] <svkampen> just having problems with the actual input
[15:14:23] [#programming] <sim642> well ok
[15:14:28] [#programming] <sim642> if you need more help just ask
[15:14:32] [#programming] <svkampen> or maybe not
[15:14:42] [#programming] <svkampen> > beep boop
[15:14:42] [#programming] <svkampen> [DEBUG]: beep boop
[15:14:42] [#programming] <svkampen> [DEBUG]: Command regex did not match input.
[15:14:51] [#programming] <svkampen> like, what is that about
[15:15:06] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> import re
[15:15:23] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (\S*)", "beep boop")
[15:15:46] [#programming] <sim642> \S+ because you don't want an argument of length 0
[15:15:54] [#programming] <svkampen> well
[15:15:55] [#programming] <sim642> oh wait
[15:15:56] [#programming] <svkampen> you could
[15:15:59] [#programming] <sim642> it's supposed to be
[15:16:13] [#programming] <svkampen> m, input, CMD_REGEX?
[15:16:15] [#programming] <sim642> wait
[15:16:16] [#programming] <svkampen> or
[15:16:21] [#programming] <sim642> I'll put the proper regex together
[15:16:55] [#programming] <sim642> (\w+)( \S)+
[15:17:02] [#programming] <sim642> it'll match the first thing
[15:17:15] [#programming] <sim642> wait no
[15:17:25] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (\S*)", "beep boop").groups()
[15:17:29] [#programming] <sim642> do you require multiple arguments?
[15:17:32] [#programming] <svkampen> yes
[15:17:35] [#programming] <svkampen> well
[15:17:37] [#programming] <svkampen> as in
[15:17:38] [#programming] <svkampen> this
[15:17:41] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (\S*)", "beep boop beep").groups()
[15:17:43] [#programming] <sim642> (\w+)( \S+)*
[15:17:45] [#programming] <svkampen> ehh
[15:17:47] [#programming] <svkampen> yeah
[15:17:55] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (.*)", "beep boop beep").groups()
[15:17:59] [#programming] <svkampen> like that
[15:18:17] [#programming] <sim642> so you don't need the arguments separate?
[15:18:20] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (\S+)*", "beep boop beep").groups()
[15:18:21] [#programming] <svkampen> no
[15:18:31] [#programming] <sim642> well then yours works, doesn't it
[15:18:35] [#programming] <svkampen> yeah
[15:18:47] [#programming] <sim642> I didn't know A-z is a thing
[15:18:55] [#programming] <sim642> I know A-Z and a-z are
[15:18:57] [#programming] <sim642> but A-z
[15:19:07] [#programming] <svkampen> that is just
[15:19:11] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> import strnig
[15:19:13] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> import string
[15:19:16] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> string.alphabet
[15:19:18] [#programming] <svkampen> or
[15:19:19] [#programming] <svkampen> whatever it is
[15:19:22] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> dir(string)
[15:19:28] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> string.ascii_letters
[15:19:46] [#programming] <svkampen> but turned around, because apparently python favors lowercase over uppercase
[15:19:49] [#programming] <sim642> I've never seen any regex thing use A-z for both upepr and lowercase
[15:19:55] [#programming] <sim642> it's always [A-Za-z]
[15:19:57] [#programming] <svkampen> it works
[15:20:00] [#programming] <sim642> but if it works then yea
[15:20:05] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (\S+)*", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:20:16] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (.*)", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:20:21] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("([A-z]+) (.*)", "beep boop beep").groups()
[15:20:34] [#programming] <svkampen> it works now
[15:24:35] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+) (.*)", "beep boop beep").groups()
[15:24:43] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+) (.*)", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:24:46] [#programming] <svkampen> hmm
[15:26:45] [#programming] <sim642> right now it wouldn't match if there weren't arguments
[15:26:54] [#programming] <sim642> like only "asd" wouldn't match
[15:26:59] [#programming] <sim642> but "asd " would
[15:29:51] [#programming] <svkampen> I have this
[15:29:54] [#programming] <svkampen> and it now matches nothing
[15:30:11] [#programming] <svkampen> (\S+) ?(.*)?
[15:32:22] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+) ?(.*)?", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:32:28] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+) ?(.*)?", "Beep boop beep")
[15:32:54] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+)(?: )?(.*)?", "Beep boop beep")
[15:32:59] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+)(?: )?(.*)", "Beep boop beep")
[15:33:03] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.match("(\S+)(?: )?(.*)", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:34:02] [#programming] <svkampen> >>> re.search("(\S+)(?: )?(.*)", "Beep boop beep").groups()
[15:37:55] [#programming] <svkampen> ah
[15:38:03] [#programming] <svkampen> apparently you have to escape twice in c++
[15:38:06] [#programming] <svkampen> so it is \\S instead of \S
[15:41:16] [#programming] <sim642> yes
[16:02:44] [#programming] <svkampen> thanks, sim642
[16:03:07] [#programming] <sim642> no problem

[16:06:47] [#programming] <Lion> wait what

[16:07:24] [#programming] <Lion> yeah
[16:07:43] [#programming] <sim642> it matches some extra shit
[16:07:49] [#programming] <Lion> [A-z] matches A-Z[\]^_`a-z
[16:07:52] [#programming] <sim642> and you forgot z from the string

[16:35:41] [#programming] <Lion> not entirely certain about the penile pederasty though
[18:30:51] [#programming] <svkampen> sim642, can I just cast a char array to a string?
[18:31:01] [#programming] <svkampen> or
[18:31:02] [#programming] <svkampen> well
[18:31:04] [#programming] <svkampen> can I do this
[18:31:08] [#programming] <svkampen> string input;
[18:31:33] [#programming] <svkampen> std::cin.getline((char[1024])input, 1024)
[18:31:49] [#programming] <svkampen> getline expects a char array
[18:31:58] [#programming] <sim642> use this instead for string
[18:32:04] [#programming] <sim642> std::getline(cin, input);
[18:32:09] [#programming] <sim642> same thing, for array
[18:32:12] [#programming] <sim642> no length limits
[18:32:36] [#programming] <cdh473> >github for windows
[18:32:37] [#programming] <cdh473> i came
[18:32:44] [#programming] <sim642> why?
[18:32:51] [#programming] <svkampen> > no github for linux
[18:32:53] [#programming] <svkampen> I didn't orgasm
[18:33:04] [#programming] <sim642> why the fuck do you need a special github program?
[18:33:08] [#programming] <sim642> it's git for fucks sake
[18:33:10] [#programming] <svkampen> github for <platform> does not make me wet
[18:33:26] [#programming] <sim642> git works already on any platform
[18:34:43] [#programming] <cdh473> no
[18:34:51] [#programming] <cdh473> it sucked on windows before
[18:35:01] [#programming] <sim642> github for windows is the same thing, just a new GUI
[18:35:12] [#programming] <cdh473> yeah
[18:35:17] [#programming] <sim642> git for windows all under the hood
[18:35:21] [#programming] <cdh473> yeah...
[18:35:27] [#programming] <cdh473> that's irrelevant
[18:35:32] [#programming] <sim642> I used tortoiusegit on windows
[18:35:33] [#programming] <sim642> worked fine
[18:37:51] [#programming] <yazdmich> i think i figured out how to store the rendered frames
[18:37:54] [#programming] <yazdmich> :D
[18:38:52] [#programming] <cdh473> god i hate writing for this client
[18:43:34] [#programming] JOIN sado|idle
[18:43:59] [#programming] <sadomaru> anybody here competent with java/swing?
[18:46:18] [#programming] <sadomaru> de?
[18:51:03] [#programming] <yazdmich> not me
[18:52:49] [#programming] <sadomaru> ah well. worth a try. knew writing this in java was gonna be painful
[18:59:49] [#programming] <svkampen> sadomaru, jadebce
[18:59:51] [#programming] <svkampen> ehh
[18:59:51] [#programming] <svkampen> oops
[18:59:52] [#programming] <cdh473> java sucks
[18:59:52] [#programming] <svkampen> kadenc
[18:59:55] [#programming] <cdh473> use c#

[19:00:06] [#programming] <svkampen> but she seems to be away
[19:00:08] [#programming] <svkampen> @seen kadence
[19:00:09] [#programming] <ChanStat> kadence (webchat@AWFL-720E2E71.jetstream.xtra.co.nz) was last seen quitting for "Quit: Web client closed" on Sat June 1 07:38:10 2013 UTC (7 hours, 22 minutes ago)
[19:02:59] [#programming] <cdh473> she lives in NZ
[19:03:05] [#programming] <svkampen> yes
[19:03:42] [#programming] <sadomaru> I don't like c#, purely because it was made by microsoft... Also it doesn't offer me anything I really need
[19:03:58] [#programming] <sadomaru> I'm using java here cause it's so portable, I won't have to worry about mac builds
[19:04:27] [#programming] <svkampen> mono
[19:04:36] [#programming] <svkampen> c# is great, sadomaru
[19:04:36] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: C# is made by a team of microsoft's that doesn't do anything else
[19:04:42] [#programming] <svkampen> and I hate microsoft
[19:04:44] [#programming] <svkampen> so
[19:04:45] [#programming] <cdh473> C# is microsoft's best product
[19:04:45] [#programming] <cdh473> ever
[19:04:48] [#programming] <svkampen> ^
[19:05:00] [#programming] <cdh473> java is a pile of shit in comparison
[19:05:41] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: and the mac build ends up needing almost no porting, if any
[19:05:45] [#programming] <sadomaru> fine, I might try it one day :P but as I say I only really use c#/java type languages for portability, and c# isn't even that portable
[19:05:52] [#programming] <cdh473> it is.
[19:06:01] [#programming] <svkampen> it really is
[19:06:11] [#programming] <svkampen> C# runs on the Common language runtime
[19:06:11] [#programming] <sadomaru> almost no porting?
[19:06:13] [#programming] <cdh473> windows, mac, linux, android, iOS
[19:06:19] [#programming] <svkampen> which has implementations on windows, -> ^
[19:06:25] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: yeah like you shouldn't have to rewrite any code
[19:06:27] [#programming] <svkampen> mono, monotouch, etc.
[19:06:28] [#programming] <sadomaru> oh, neat.
[19:06:38] [#programming] <svkampen> it gives you a .exe
[19:06:39] [#programming] <svkampen> but
[19:06:41] [#programming] <svkampen> don't be fooled
[19:06:43] [#programming] <svkampen> it isn't a PE
[19:06:54] [#programming] <cdh473> yeah it looks more professional :P
[19:07:09] [#programming] <svkampen> cdh473, it looks more windowsy
[19:07:16] [#programming] <sadomaru> mono isn't fantastic on linux iirc
[19:07:21] [#programming] <cdh473> having the guy you hired to write you a program give you a .jar is weird
[19:07:22] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: it is
[19:07:25] [#programming] <sadomaru> didn't even realise it worked on mac
[19:07:28] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: you must have heard that years age
[19:07:30] [#programming] <cdh473> ago*
[19:07:33] [#programming] <svkampen> sadomaru, it does not support WPF, but other than that, it's pretty good
[19:07:59] [#programming] <sadomaru> well I was talking from experience, but it might have just been a buggy program then
[19:08:20] [#programming] <cdh473> it has GTK
[19:08:25] [#programming] <svkampen> yeah
[19:08:28] [#programming] <svkampen> I guess it does
[19:09:13] [#programming] <sadomaru> some other professional devs tried to convince me to use c# too a while ago... I suppose it's worth a try then
[19:09:24] [#programming] <sadomaru> a bit late for what I'm writing though
[19:10:02] [#programming] <cdh473> sadomaru: i've been through everything from FASM to Haskell and C# is my favorite "workhorse" language
[19:10:56] [#programming] <sadomaru> oh I loved fasm! Wrote tetris in that a few years ago, great fun. Never liked the look of haskell though
[19:11:02] [#programming] <cdh473> lol
[19:11:11] [#programming] <cdh473> must not be a big math fan then
[19:11:24] [#programming] <svkampen> CmdEnvironment.cpp:35:22: error: variable or field ‘get_cmd’ declared void
[19:11:25] [#programming] <svkampen>  void CmdEnvironment::get_cmd {
[19:11:25] [#programming] <svkampen> ehhhh
[19:11:26] [#programming] <svkampen> what
[19:11:42] [#programming] <sadomaru> nope, I love maths, it's just GHC is massive, and really badly structured
[19:12:06] [#programming] <cdh473> no
[19:12:17] [#programming] <cdh473> ghc is massive and delicious
[19:12:18] [#programming] <cdh473> :P
[19:12:25] [#programming] <cdh473> you a lisp fan?
[19:12:46] [#programming] <sadomaru> each to their own :P Yep I like the look of lisp, but I've never really got into it
[19:12:54] [#programming] <sadomaru> maybe when I try and switch to emacs again
[19:13:07] [#programming] <cdh473> nooo
[19:13:11] [#programming] <cdh473> gotta learn scheme first
[19:13:27] [#programming] <cdh473> lisp is a glorious thing
[19:13:39] [#programming] <svkampen> cdh473, I've never been able to functional language
[19:13:48] [#programming] <cdh473> why not
[19:13:49] [#programming] <svkampen> maybe I am just an imperial person
[19:13:51] [#programming] <svkampen> idk
[19:13:56] [#programming] <svkampen> I didn't get them
[19:13:59] [#programming] <cdh473> imperical
[19:14:04] [#programming] <cdh473> wait lol wat
[19:14:11] [#programming] <cdh473> svkampen: recursion...
[19:14:22] [#programming] <svkampen> ?
[19:14:29] [#programming] <sadomaru> functional languages are the best
[19:14:42] [#programming] <cdh473> i got out of that loop a bit
[19:14:48] [#programming] <cdh473> back into python and C#
[19:15:00] [#programming] <cdh473> the old trusty languages i've been using for the past 7 years
[19:15:37] [#programming] <sadomaru> meh. I refused to use object oriented languages for a long time. I'm happy with them now, but I still prefer functional
[19:17:05] [#programming] <sadomaru> what's you guise's take on D?
[19:17:33] [#programming] <cdh473> hipster language
[19:17:42] [#programming] <sadomaru> haha
[19:18:05] [#programming] <cdh473> the thing with C# and python is they both allow alll kiiiiindzzz of paradigms
[19:18:09] [#programming] <sadomaru> one of my friends describes it as taking the best parts of C++, java and python and mixing them together
[19:18:38] [#programming] <sadomaru> true
[19:19:45] [#programming] <cdh473> no, that's C#
[19:20:33] [#programming] <sadomaru> hah
[19:21:25] [#programming] <svkampen> I am doing some c++ now
[19:21:28] [#programming] <svkampen> because
[19:21:28] [#programming] <svkampen> fun
[19:21:49] [#programming] <svkampen> it is a lot more complicated than python
[19:21:51] [#programming] <svkampen> but I am enjoying myself
[19:21:52] [#programming] <svkampen> so
[19:22:15] [#programming] <sadomaru> it's an awesome language
[19:22:33] [#programming] <cdh473> meh i prefer C tbh
[19:22:53] [#programming] <sadomaru> I was thinking of C when I wrote that, i've rarely actually used c++
[19:23:11] [#programming] <svkampen> c++ has some cool stuff c doesn't have
[19:23:17] [#programming] <svkampen> like actual fucking strings
[19:23:20] [#programming] <cdh473> s/cool/slow/
[19:23:24] [#programming] <svkampen> instead of const char pointers
[19:23:56] [#programming] <cdh473> svkampen: same shit under the hood, just strings have an object wrapping them
[19:24:27] [#programming] <svkampen> vectors
[19:24:33] [#programming] <svkampen> a good threading library
[19:24:34] [#programming] <svkampen> boost
[19:24:36] [#programming] <cdh473> lel
[19:24:39] [#programming] <cdh473> leleeelellllelelllell
[19:24:48] [#programming] <cdh473> C: for writing OSes
[19:24:57] [#programming] <cdh473> the only thing we need C/C++ for anyways
[19:25:01] [#programming] <cdh473> huurrrrr i am torvalds
[19:25:13] [#programming] <svkampen> what about torvalds
[19:25:20] [#programming] <svkampen> want to see source code statistics about linux?
[19:25:33] [#programming] <svkampen> ~github.stats_for torvalds/linux
[19:25:37] [#programming] <svkampen> eh
[19:25:38] [#programming] <svkampen> oops
[19:25:50] [#programming] <svkampen> this is a dev release, so there are certainly bugs
[19:25:51] [#programming] <svkampen> ~quit
[19:26:45] [#programming] JOIN jamesnext
[19:26:49] [#programming] <svkampen> sadomaru, he created linux though
[19:26:52] [#programming] <svkampen> I am pretty grateful
[19:27:00] [#programming] <svkampen> ~github.stats_for torvalds/linux
[19:27:04] [#programming] <svkampen> rrrgh
