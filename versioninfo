Okay, because it is kind of weird how versions work at the moment, I shall explain.

If I commit on the second of march, 2012, the Build Date is 02032012.
In this case, the version is 12.3.2 - so the date is turned around, dotted, and zeros are removed.

I will, from now on, paste the version in the commit name, and the Build Date and version in the
file itself.

The commit number seems pretty straight-forward to me, so...

Bye,
